                    <br/>
                    <p>Welcome to Roco Mama's at Pine City Mall!</p>
                    <br/>
                    <p>Start a feeding frenzy when you visit any of our restaurants and have any of our Smash Burgers, ribs or wings!</p>
                    <br/>
                    <p>Founded in July 2013, RocoMamas has fast become one of the trendiest restaurants in South Africa, garnering a loyal following of burger enthusiasts. Their brand position of “Not Normal” is evident in their funky décor, rock ‘n roll vibe, unique menu items and an open-style kitchen where customers can see (and smell) the meals being prepared.</p>
                    <br/>
                    <p>Customers can sit down and soak up the laid-back vibe with a burger and craft beer or choose to order a takeout thanks to the speedy service. RocoMamas has a menu that goes far beyond your typical burger joint; it’s all about customisation.</p>
                    <br/>
                    <p>Famous for their artisanal style “Smashburgers”, the franchise also serves chicken wings and ribs as their core offering. The Smashburger concept refers to the process of smashing a ball of ground beef o‌n a hot grill to seal in the juices, rather than squeezing them out. This results in a medium to well-done burger that is very juicy. </p>
