                    <h2>FIRST NATIONAL BANK</h2>
                    <br/>
                    <p>Welcome to FNB at Pine City Mall!</p>
                    <br/>
                    <p>FNB is the oldest bank in South Africa, and can be traced back to the Eastern Province Bank formed in Grahamstown in 1838. Today, FNB trades as a division of FirstRand Bank Limited. When looking at FNB's history, two things in particular stand out. The first is a story of survival - different circumstances in South Africa have posed many great challenges in our history, all of which FNB has successfully met. This track record provides a strong foundation for our future challenges. The second is a story of people - our history has always been firmly influenced by the needs of the people we serve.</p>
                    <br/>
                    <p>A landmark development in FNB's history took place in 1998 when the financial services interests of Rand Merchant Bank Holdings and Anglo American were merged to form FirstRand Limited. In the process, FNB was delisted from the JSE on 22 May 1998 to become a wholly-owned subsidiary of FirstRand, which was listed on the JSE on 25 May 1998. On 30 June 1999, the banking interests of FirstRand formally merged into a single entity to form FirstRand Bank. FNB, WesBank and RMB now trade as divisions of FirstRand Bank.</p>
                    <br/>
                    <p>FNB views sustainability as a business practice which creates value for stakeholders through managing environmental, social and governance factors impacting the company's ability to generate sustainable profits. We are a values based organization, with core values of pride, accountability, innovation, Ubuntu and respect. </p>
                    <br/>
                    <p>These values serve as a guide when making business decisions and in our dealings with all stakeholders, including colleagues, customers, investors, suppliers, the community and the environment.</p>
